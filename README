None of the TriMet apps out there did exactly what I
wanted, and this does.  It's a prototype right now;
if there's interest, I may actually make more than just
something for personal use.

The "razors" are the things that actually slice out
exactly the information I want from the *flood* of
data that TriMet provides.  They're all in Razors.py.
Each razor spits out only a list of estimated arrival
times for a single TriMet StopID in seconds until
vehicle arrival.  The only razor that exists right now
is the Streetcar one.  No bus or MAX stops are
supported yet, because I almost never use them.

TriMetRazor.py stores the GUI.  The StopID is hard coded
in here along with most everything else.

I wrote this with Python 2.7, Qt4, and PyQt4 using
versions available on 2014-05-26.
